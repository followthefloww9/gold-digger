# XAU/USD Scalping Strategy

## Strategy Overview
**Name:** Smart Money Concept (SMC) + Liquidity Grab + Order Block (OB) Entry  
**Asset:** Gold (XAU/USD)  
**Type:** Institutional-style scalping strategy  

## Core Concept
Gold (XAU/USD) is an extremely liquid and manipulated instrument, making it ideal for an institutional-style trading approach based on:
- Liquidity accumulation (stop-hunts)
- False breakouts of key levels
- Reversal in strong institutional zones (Order Blocks)
- Market structure shift (Break of Structure – BOS)

## Configuration

### Timeframes
- **Analysis:** H1 / M15
- **Entry:** M1 / M5

### Trading Sessions
- **London:** 09:00–12:00 BG
- **New York:** 15:30–18:00 BG

### Technical Indicators
- VWAP
- Session High/Low indicator
- EMA 50/200
- FVG (Fair Value Gap) / OB (Order Block) zones

### Trading Filters
- Do not trade against major news events (NFP, FOMC)
- Only trade on clear Break of Structure (BOS)

## Strategy Steps

### Step 1: Identify Liquidity
- Look for previous highs/lows where stop losses have clustered
- Use indicators or manually mark Session High/Low and Asian Range
- Focus on areas where retail traders typically place stops

### Step 2: Liquidity Grab (Stop Hunt)
- Wait for price to break a key level (upwards or downwards)
- Confirm immediate retracement back into the range
- Identify Order Block (OB) formation with clear rejection

### Step 3: Structure Shift (BOS)
- Confirm Break of Structure on lower timeframe (M1/M5)
- This validates potential reversal direction

### Step 4: Retest Entry
- Enter position on retest of the Order Block or Fair Value Gap zone
- **Stop Loss:** Place above/below the OB or last significant high/low (3–7 pips)
- **Take Profit:** Target 1:2 risk-reward ratio or next liquidity zone / VWAP

## Sample Trade Setup

**Session:** New York – 16:00 BG

1. Price breaks Asia session low → liquidity grabbed
2. Clear rejection forms bullish Order Block on M5 timeframe
3. Break of Structure confirmed on M1 → trade confirmation
4. Execute retest entry → Stop Loss under Order Block, Take Profit at 1:2 ratio (targeting VWAP)
